## As Teaching Assistant (Stanford)
- Probability Theory for Statistical Inference (STATS 118): Fall 2025.
- Statistical Learning and Data Science (STATS 202): Fall 2024.

## As Teaching Assistant (Harvard)
- Introduction to Statistical Inference (STAT 111): Spring 2024.
- Machine Learning (CS 181): Spring 2022, Spring 2023 (Co-Head Teaching Fellow).
- Introduction to Probability (STAT 110): Fall 2021, 2022, and 2023.

## Select Pedagogical Resources
- **Introduction to Probability (STAT 110 @ Harvard):** these two files together should provide the motivated student, regardless of incoming background, with a quite solid review of the entire STAT 110 curriculum. Special thanks to my long-time co-TF Catherine Huang for collaborating with me on these resources.
  - [Midterm Review Guide (Fall 2023)](https://skbwu.github.io/files/110-midterm-review.pdf) and [Final Review Guide (Fall 2023)](https://skbwu.github.io/files/110-final-review.pdf).
- **Machine Learning (CS 181 @ Harvard):**
  - [Code Crash Course (Spring 2023)](https://skbwu.github.io/files/181-code-crash-course.pdf): a self-contained crash course on Python assuming no coding background whatsoever. Covers stock Python, `NumPy`, `Matplotlib`, and some other goodies.
  - [Practical Section (Spring 2023)](https://skbwu.github.io/files/181-practical-section.pdf): a short, practical tour of `scikit-learn`, `PyTorch`, and fundamental dataset-loading practices.
  - [Matrix Calculus for CS 181 (Spring 2023+)](https://skbwu.github.io/files/181-matrix-calculus.pdf): an introduction to matrix and vector derivatives with some commonly-used examples.
  - [The Differential, A More Advanced Method for Matrix Derivatives for CS 181 (Spring 2023+)](https://skbwu.github.io/files/181-matrix-differentials.pdf): an introduction to using differential operators to more efficiently compute matrix and vector derivatives.

## Awards
- Certificate of Distinction in Teaching: Fall 2021 and Spring 2022, Harvard University, Derek Bok Center for Teaching and Learning. Award discontinued starting Fall 2022.

## Sample Section Leader Evaluations (Harvard)
- [CS 181: Machine Learning (Spring 2023)](https://skbwu.github.io/files/spring-2023-181.pdf): I served as co-Head Teaching Fellow during this semester under Professor Weiwei Pan.
- [STAT 110: Introduction to Probability (Fall 2023)](https://skbwu.github.io/files/fall-2023-110.pdf): this was my last (of three) semesters serving as an undergraduate teaching fellow for STAT 110, all under Professor Joe Blitzstein.
